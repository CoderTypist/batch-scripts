DESCRIPTION:
Opens a specified web address a specific number of times in an incogonito chrome window.

INTENDED PURPOSE:
To make it seem as if a lot of people are viewing a Google Doc.

HOW TO USE:
Change website to the web address that you want to open.
Change numWindows to be the number of tabs you want to open.
To open in a normal chrome tab (not in incognito), remove the "--incognito" parameter.
Keep in mind that openning too many tabs can cause problems, so keep numWindows at a reasonable number.

WHY I MADE THIS SCRIPT:
If somebody has enabled a shareable link for a Google Doc, you can open multiple instances of that document on separate tabs.
If you are signed out of your Google account, each tab you open to view the document will show 
an additional "anonymous animal" viewing the document.
If you open open the document ten times, ten anonymous animals will be shown to be viewing the document.
However, if you are signed into your Google account, it will show that you are viewing the document.
Opening more tabs will not increase the number of people viewing the document.
The simple solution is to sign out of your Google Account. 
However, if you want to stay signed in, you can simply open the tabs in an incognito window.

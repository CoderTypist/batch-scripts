DESCRIPTION: Keeps a log of everytime the computer is booted.

INTENDED PURPOSE: To keep track of whether someone is using your computer at odd times.
Maybe you have kids and you want to see if they are using the computer late at night.

HOW TO USE:

1) Download bootLogInstaller.bat

2) Run bootLogInstaller.bat

3) Delete bootLogInstaller.bat so that other users can't see the code and know where the used files are being stored.

4) Go to C:\ProgramData\Programs and open bootLog.txt to see when the computer has been booted. The Programs folder is hidden, so 
if you want to navigate to it directly through the file explorer, enable the displaying of hidden folders and files.

DRAW BACKS: If the person using your computer is good with computers, they may find the bootLog.txt file and modify it as they choose. 
However, if they are not tech savy, then you have no need to worry.

NOTE: Don't tell anybody that you can keep track of who turns on your computer! Even if somebody is tech savy, they are unlikely
to find these files unless they are looking for them, and they shouldn't, unless you tip them off and give them reason to look for them.
Telling somebody that you log who turns on your computer is an instant give away about where to look.
